### 🔍 About Me

I'm a **Python developer and AI engineer** with a passion for building scalable systems that solve real-world problems. My journey began in **Marketing and Sales**, leading high-performing teams across  Pharma FMCG and Service sectors. Now, I bring that business insight into tech—automating workflows, crafting APIs, and building smart applications.

- 💡 I build with **Django, FastAPI, Flask**, and deploy using **Docker, GitHub Actions**, and **Nginx**.
- 🤖 I experiment with **LLMs, RAG pipelines**, and **intelligent agents** using **LangChain**, **Hugging Face**, and **OpenAI API**.
- 📊 I’ve worked on **real-time data pipelines**, **e-commerce platforms**, and **data visualization dashboards**.
- 🌐 I’m exploring **Web3** and how **blockchain** can enable trustless systems.
