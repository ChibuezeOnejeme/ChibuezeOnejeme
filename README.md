  <br/>

I am a Sales and Business development professional with over 8 years of experience working for a fortune 500 company turned Fullstack Developer.

### Personal Story
I graduated with a Marketing Degree and have explored the business environment,i have worked in the pharmaceutical space as well as the fmcg sector, my job titles are as follows ;channel innovation executive,Trade marketing representative, Business Development Representaive,Distributor Developer and Sales Manager.

  As a Sales Manager I have Managed and led 11(Eleven) Business Development Represntative and 20 distributors.
  
I have noticed from experience that many business tasks are done manually which led to alot of down time, wastages and ineficiencies.
  
The above business problem of manual and tedious tasks sparked my interest to search for solution ,which led me to programming.
  
Python was my first language and because its the king of automation , it help me speedup processes,improve collaborations and infact i decided to solve the business problem from the side of 💻.
